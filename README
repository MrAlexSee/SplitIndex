### To compile:
1. Select the compiler (CC) in Makefile.inc (tested on clang version 3.4-1ubuntu3).
2. Set the path to Boost (INCLUDE) in Makefile.inc (tested on Boost 1.57).
3. Select the debug or release version (OPTFLAGS) in Makefile.inc.
4. Tweak the parameters in src/main/params.hpp.
5. Type make.

### To use:
1. The executable path is build/main.
2. Usage: build/main [dict] [opt: queries]
   The first parameter is a text file with the input (the database of keywords). Any whitespace is a default separator for words.
   The second parameter is a text file with queries. If not supplied, queries are randomly generated from the input.

### To test:
1. Set the index you want to check in src/params.hpp.
2. Set the same k in testing/naive_hamming.py.
3. Set the paths in testing/run_and_compare.sh.
4. Type testing/run_and_compare.sh.
